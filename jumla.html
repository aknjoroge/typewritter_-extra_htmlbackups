    Jumla Cuts is a specialty butchery shop that opened its doors in October
2017 in Kiambu, Kenya.
The concept was born from the lack of high quality meats in the market
that guaranteed consumers of safely processed meats. Guided by the
international standards of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point(HACCP)
we purposed to serve our clients with nothing but quality products.
The company operates as a processor and distributor of fresh beef, Capon
Chicken, Goat and fish fillet.
Vision Statement: To position ourselves as retailers and wholesalers of
consistently high quality meats.</h3>
